CO SIE Z TYMI 000 DZIEJEEEE

Edit RozbitaScreenowka to modify option in settings Odsłaniaj w częściach

Make it pre-split the iamge based on the number of parts specified (make it % based so if the number of parts is 4, split the image in to 4 parts consisting of 25% of pieces) and than every mouse or space click will reveal one part and deduct the points (beyond the first)




can you help me fix this component
now the unobstructed image pokes through and the image is also visible on the sides outside of the image piece generation zone
